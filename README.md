# Flappy Bird NEAT AI

The Flappy Bird NEAT AI project is a game that demonstrates a genetic algorithm (NEAT) applied to train a neural network to play the Flappy Bird game. This is a project for my 4th semester of BSCS.

## Introduction

The Flappy Bird NEAT AI project uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to evolve a neural network capable of playing the Flappy Bird game. The project uses the `pygame` library to simulate the game environment and visualize the training process.

## Features

- Implement NEAT algorithm to evolve neural networks.
- Simulate the Flappy Bird game using `pygame`.
- Display the current score, generation count, and the number of alive birds.
- Visualize the game and training process.

## Getting Started

To run the Flappy Bird NEAT AI project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
3. Run the main script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed on your system to install the required packages and run the application.

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running `python main.py`.
2. The neural networks will start playing the Flappy Bird game, and the training process will be visualized on the screen.
3. Observe the evolving neural networks as they attempt to maximize their fitness by playing the game.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and write to the data file.
- The game environment and training visualization are displayed using `pygame`.
